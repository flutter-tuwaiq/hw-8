## Homework #8
Your task is to create a simple image upload API using the Shelf and Dart frameworks. The API should allow users to upload an image file and store it on the file project.

## Requirements:

<!-- - Create a new Dart project and set up the necessary dependencies (`shelf`) in the `pubspec.yaml` file. -->
<!-- - Implement a basic server using the Shelf framework. -->
<!-- - Create an endpoint that accepts POST requests for uploading an image. -->
<!-- - The API should support uploading images in common formats such as JPEG and PNG. -->
<!-- - The uploaded image should be saved on the file project. -->
<!-- - Generate a unique filename for each uploaded image to avoid conflicts. -->
<!-- - Provide appropriate error handling and response messages for different scenarios (e.g., invalid file format). -->
<!-- - Add appropriate logging to track the incoming requests and their status. -->

### Optional Enhancements (Bonus):

<!-- - Implement image validation to ensure the uploaded file is indeed an image. -->
- Allow users to specify a preferred filename for the uploaded image.
- Add functionality to resize or manipulate the uploaded image before saving it.
<!-- - Create an endpoint that accepts POST requests for uploading a video. -->

### Deliverables:

- Submit your Dart project code, including all the necessary files.

### Required Dependencies:

<!-- - `shelf`: Used for building the HTTP server and handling requests. -->
<!-- - `shelf_hot_reload`: Enables hot reloading for faster development iterations. -->
<!-- - `dart_code_metrics`: Provides code analysis and metrics for improving code quality. -->

## Note:

- Use `shelf_hot_reload` to automatically reload the server when you make changes to the code during development, improving development efficiency.
- Utilize `dart_code_metrics` to analyze your code and ensure good coding practices, maintainability, and readability.
- You can use any additional libraries or packages if needed, but be sure to document them properly.
- Feel free to explore and be creative with the design and implementation of your API.
